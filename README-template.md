## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this project I wanted to practice some of the react component creation and how to add props. You would observe that the use of props might be exaggerated for this purpose.

### Continued development

I would work on attempting this project using tailwind as the style tool, to further better understand the react library.
